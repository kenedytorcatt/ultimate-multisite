## 📋 Requirements

- PHP 7.4.30 or higher
- MySQL 5.6 or higher

## 🔧 Installation

> **Important:** Do not use GitHub's green **"Code → Download ZIP"** button on this page. That archive is the raw source code and is missing the compiled dependencies — installing it will produce errors such as `Failed opening required .../vendor/autoload_packages.php`. Always download from the [**Releases page**](https://github.com/Ultimate-Multisite/ultimate-multisite/releases) instead.

There are three ways to install Ultimate Multisite:

### Method 1: From the WordPress Plugin Directory (Recommended)

1. Log in to your WordPress Network Admin dashboard
2. Navigate to **Plugins > Add New**
3. Search for **"Ultimate Multisite"**
4. Click **"Install Now"** on the Ultimate Multisite plugin
5. Network Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu
6. Follow the step-by-step Wizard to set the plugin up

You can also browse the plugin listing at [wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-multisite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-multisite/).

### Method 2: Using the pre-packaged release from GitHub

1. Download the latest release ZIP from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Ultimate-Multisite/ultimate-multisite/releases)
2. Log in to your WordPress Network Admin dashboard
3. Navigate to Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin
4. Choose the downloaded ZIP file and click "Install Now"
5. Network Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
6. Follow the step-by-step Wizard to set the plugin up

### Method 3: Using Git and Composer (For developers)

This method requires command-line access to your server and familiarity with Git and Composer.

1. Clone the repository to your plugins directory:

   ```bash
   cd wp-content/plugins/
   git clone https://github.com/Ultimate-Multisite/ultimate-multisite.git
   cd ultimate-multisite
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Network Activate the plugin in your WordPress Network Admin dashboard
4. Follow the setup wizard to complete the installation

## 🔍 Common Installation Issues

<details>
<summary><strong>"Failed opening required [...]/vendor/autoload_packages.php"</strong></summary>
<p>This error occurs when the required vendor files are missing. This typically happens when:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You've downloaded the repository directly from GitHub without using a release package</li>
  <li>The composer dependencies haven't been installed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use the pre-packaged release from the <a href="https://github.com/Ultimate-Multisite/ultimate-multisite/releases">Releases page</a> or run <code>composer install</code> in the plugin directory.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"Cannot declare class ComposerAutoloaderInitWPUltimoDependencies, because the name is already in use"</strong></summary>
<p>This error usually occurs when updating from an older version of WP Ultimo or when multiple versions of the plugin are installed.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Deactivate and remove any older versions of WP Ultimo or Ultimate Multisite before activating the new version.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"Class 'WP_Ultimo\Database\Sites\Site_Query' not found"</strong></summary>
<p>This error can occur if the plugin's autoloader isn't properly loading all the necessary classes.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use the pre-packaged release from the <a href="https://github.com/Ultimate-Multisite/ultimate-multisite/releases">Releases page</a> which includes all required files.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Site screenshots show a Cloudflare challenge page instead of the actual site</strong></summary>
<p>Ultimate Multisite uses <a href="https://www.thum.io/">thum.io</a> to generate site screenshots. If your network is behind Cloudflare with Bot Fight Mode or similar protections enabled, thum.io's screenshot bot may be blocked and return a Cloudflare challenge page instead of your site screenshot.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Create a Cloudflare WAF exception rule to allow thum.io's bot:</p>

<ol>
<li>Log in to your <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare dashboard</a></li>
<li>Select your domain</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Security → WAF → Custom rules</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>Create rule</strong></li>
<li>Configure the rule:
<ul>
<li><strong>Rule name:</strong> <code>Allow thum.io screenshot bot</code></li>
<li><strong>Field:</strong> <code>User Agent</code></li>
<li><strong>Operator:</strong> <code>contains</code></li>
<li><strong>Value:</strong> <code>Thum.io</code></li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> <code>Skip</code> → Select all skip options (WAF, Rate Limiting, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click <strong>Deploy</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, if you use Cloudflare's Super Bot Fight Mode, you can add an exception in <strong>Security → Bots → Configure Super Bot Fight Mode</strong> to allow verified bots or specific user agents.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Screenshots require sites to be publicly accessible. Local development environments cannot generate screenshots regardless of Cloudflare settings.</p>
</details>

## 🚀 Contributing

We welcome contributions to Ultimate Multisite! Here's how you can contribute effectively:

### Development Workflow

1. **Quick Setup:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ultimate-Multisite/ultimate-multisite.git
   cd wp-multisite-waas
   npm run dev:setup  # Installs dependencies and sets up Git hooks
   ```

2. **Development Commands:**
   ```bash
   npm test              # Run tests
   npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage
   npm run lint         # Check code style (PHPCS)
   npm run lint:fix     # Fix code style automatically
   npm run stan         # Run static analysis (PHPStan)
   npm run quality      # Run lint + stan
   npm run check        # Run all quality checks
   npm run build        # Production build
   npm run build:dev    # Development build
   npm run clean        # Clean build artifacts
   ```

3. **Making Changes:**
   - Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/amazing-feature`)
   - Make your changes with tests
   - Git hooks will automatically run PHPCS and PHPStan on changed files
   - Commit using conventional format: `feat(scope): description`
   - Run `npm run check` before pushing
   - Push and create a Pull Request

4. **Code Quality:**
   - Pre-commit hooks run automatically
   - Follow WordPress coding standards
   - Include tests for new features
   - Maintain >80% code coverage
   - Use conventional commit messages

5. **Important:** Update both README.md and readme.txt files when making changes that affect versions, features, or documentation.

### Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting pull requests, please:

1. Include a clear description of the changes and their purpose
2. Reference any related issues using GitHub's issue linking syntax (#123)
3. Ensure your code follows the existing style and conventions
4. Include screenshots or GIFs for UI changes if applicable
5. Make sure all tests pass (if available)
6. Update documentation as needed
7. Verify that both README.md and readme.txt are updated and synchronized

### Release Process

Releases are automated using GitHub Actions workflows that trigger when a version tag is pushed.

**Tagging Convention:** To trigger a new release build, push a tag following the semantic versioning format:

```bash
git tag v2.3.5  # For example, for version 2.3.5
git push origin v2.3.5
```

The tag must begin with "v" followed by the version number (v*.*.\*)

This will automatically:

1. Build the plugin (run `npm run build`)
2. Create a properly packaged ZIP file
3. Create a GitHub release with the ZIP attached

When preparing for a release:

1. Update the version number in the main plugin file and readme.txt
2. Update the changelog in readme.txt
3. Ensure README.md and readme.txt are synchronized with the latest information
4. Create and push the appropriate version tag

## ✅ Testing
